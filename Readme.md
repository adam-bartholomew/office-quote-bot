## A Twitter Bot that tweets random quotes from the TV show "The Office".
#### Created by [Adam Bartholomew](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-bartholomew/) using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Tweepy](https://docs.tweepy.org/en/stable/index.html).
_With credit and inspiration from [Josh Richard](https://github.com/joshuarichard)_

#### Notes:
* This connects to my own personal Twitter account [here](https://twitter.com/The_Adumb).
* The bot used to be hosted via AWS on a EC2 free tier account, but I removed that in order to avoid being charged once I went past any service limits. Now it is only run locally.

#### Purpose:
* Learn and explore how to interact with an API. 
* Maintain and Expand my knowledge of Python. 
* Explore any creative ideas.

#### Lessons Learned:
* How to set up a custom logger.
* How to package a library and import it into the main program.
* How to define dictionaries and functions to access/modify those dictionaries.
* How to read and write to files.
